# Security Policy

CFIPros takes the security of our aviation training platform seriously. This document outlines our security practices, supported versions, and how to report security vulnerabilities responsibly.

## 🛡️ Security Commitment

As an aviation training platform, security is critical to protecting:

- **Student and instructor data**: Personal information and training records
- **Educational content**: Proprietary training materials and assessments
- **Platform integrity**: Preventing unauthorized access and data breaches
- **Aviation compliance**: Meeting industry security standards

## 📋 Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status                                  |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ **Current**     | Active development and security patches |
| 0.9.x   | ⚠️ **Limited**     | Critical security fixes only            |
| < 0.9   | ❌ **End of Life** | No longer supported                     |

### Update Recommendations

- **Production deployments**: Always use the latest stable release
- **Development**: Keep dependencies updated with `npm audit fix`
- **Security patches**: Apply immediately when available

## 🔒 Security Features

This codebase implements multiple layers of security:

### Frontend Security

- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all user inputs
- **File Upload Security**: Magic byte validation and content scanning
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS
- **Authentication**: Secure session management
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications encrypted
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

### File Upload Security

```typescript
// Example: Our comprehensive file validation
import { FileUploadSecurity } from "@/lib/security/fileUpload";

const validation = await FileUploadSecurity.validateFile(file);
if (!validation.isSecure) {
  throw new SecurityError(validation.error);
}
```

### API Security

- **Request validation**: All endpoints validate inputs
- **Error handling**: No sensitive information in error responses
- **CORS policy**: Restricted cross-origin access
- **Security headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
