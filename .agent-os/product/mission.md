# Product Mission

## Pitch

CFIPros ACS Extractor is a FastAPI service that helps pilots, flight instructors, and aviation training organizations identify weak areas from FAA Knowledge Test reports by providing automated ACS code extraction and personalized study plan generation.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Pilots**: Student pilots and certificated pilots seeking to improve their knowledge and pass FAA written exams
- **Flight Instructors**: CFIs who need to efficiently identify student weak areas and create targeted lesson plans
- **Flight Schools**: Aviation training organizations looking to improve student pass rates and training efficiency
- **Aviation Training Organizations**: Larger institutions that need to track performance across multiple students and programs

### User Personas

**Student Pilot** (18-65 years old)
- **Role:** Private, Instrument, Commercial, or ATP candidate
- **Context:** Preparing for or has taken FAA written exams
- **Pain Points:** Difficulty interpreting score reports, unclear study priorities, generic study materials
- **Goals:** Pass written exams efficiently, focus study time on weak areas, improve aviation knowledge retention

**Certified Flight Instructor** (22-70 years old)
- **Role:** CFI, CFII, MEI providing flight training
- **Context:** Managing multiple students with varying knowledge gaps
- **Pain Points:** Time-consuming manual analysis of student score reports, difficulty creating personalized lesson plans
- **Goals:** Efficiently identify student weak areas, create targeted instruction, improve student success rates

## The Problem

### Inefficient Knowledge Gap Analysis

Pilots receive FAA Knowledge Test score reports that show only broad subject areas and percentage scores, making it difficult to identify specific weak areas for focused study. This leads to inefficient study time allocation and lower pass rates.

**Our Solution:** Automated extraction of specific ACS codes from score reports with detailed breakdown of knowledge areas.

### Manual Study Plan Creation

Flight instructors spend significant time manually analyzing score reports and creating individualized study plans for each student, reducing time available for actual instruction.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered study plan generation that automatically creates personalized learning paths based on identified weak areas.

### Limited Performance Tracking

Aviation training organizations lack comprehensive tools to track student performance patterns and identify common knowledge gaps across their programs.

**Our Solution:** Aggregated analytics and national data collection (PII-scrubbed) to identify training trends and optimize curriculum.

## Differentiators

### AI-Powered ACS Code Extraction

Unlike manual score report analysis or generic study tools, we provide automated extraction of specific Airman Certification Standards (ACS) codes from any format (PDF, scanned documents, photos). This results in precise identification of knowledge gaps with 95%+ accuracy for digital PDFs and 90%+ for scanned/photo documents.

### Multi-Format Processing Capability

Unlike competitors that only handle digital PDFs, our system processes multiple input formats including scanned documents and smartphone photos using advanced OCR and computer vision. This results in universal accessibility regardless of how students receive their score reports.

### Aviation-Specific Intelligence

Unlike general-purpose document processing tools, our system is specifically trained on FAA Knowledge Test formats and ACS structures, providing aviation industry expertise built into every extraction and recommendation.
