# Development Best Practices

Global development guidelines for CFI Pros API projects. These standards promote maintainable, readable, and reliable code.

## Core Principles

### 1. Keep It Simple (KISS)
- Write code that solves the immediate problem without unnecessary complexity
- Choose the most straightforward solution that meets requirements
- Avoid premature optimization and over-abstraction
- Prefer explicit code over clever shortcuts

### 2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or modules
- Create shared utilities for common operations
- Use configuration files for repeated values
- Abstract repeated UI patterns into components

### 3. Optimize for Readability
- Write self-documenting code with descriptive names
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Add comments to explain "why", not "what"
- Structure code logically with clear separation of concerns

## Code Organization

### File Structure
- One primary responsibility per file
- Group related functionality in the same directory
- Use descriptive file and directory names
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible

### Function Design
- Functions should do one thing well
- Limit parameters to 3-4 when possible
- Return early to reduce nesting
- Use pure functions when feasible

## Error Handling

### General Principles
- Handle errors at the appropriate level
- Use specific error types and messages
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Fail fast and provide clear feedback

### API Error Handling
```javascript
// Good: Specific error handling
try {
  const result = await apiCall();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 404) {
    throw new NotFoundError(`Resource not found: ${resourceId}`);
  }
  throw new ApiError(`API call failed: ${error.message}`);
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
- Write tests that are easy to read and maintain
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Coverage
- Aim for 80% code coverage as a baseline
- Focus on testing business logic and edge cases
- Write integration tests for critical user flows
- Test error conditions and boundary cases

## Performance Guidelines

### Database Queries
- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Avoid N+1 queries through proper eager loading
- Limit query results with pagination
- Use database-level constraints when possible

### API Performance
- Implement response caching where appropriate
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Minimize payload size
- Add database indexes for query optimization

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs at the API boundary
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize data before processing
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use established authentication libraries
- Implement proper session management
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Log security-relevant events

## Dependencies

### Choosing Libraries
- Prefer well-maintained, popular libraries
- Check for recent updates and active maintenance
- Evaluate bundle size impact
- Review security advisories

### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regular security audits
- Document why specific versions are pinned
- Remove unused dependencies
