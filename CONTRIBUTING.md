# Contributing to CFIPros Frontend

Welcome to the CFIPros community! We're excited that you want to contribute to making aviation training better for everyone. ‚úàÔ∏è

## üåü Ways to Contribute

### üêõ Bug Reports
Found something that doesn't work as expected? Help us fix it!

**Before reporting:**
- Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/marcusgoll/CFIPros-frontend/issues)
- Try to reproduce the issue with the latest version
- Test in different browsers if it's a UI issue

### üí° Feature Requests
Have ideas for improving aviation training workflows? We'd love to hear them!

**Great feature requests include:**
- Clear description of the problem you're solving
- Specific use cases from aviation training
- Mockups or wireframes (if applicable)
- Consideration of how it fits with existing features

### üîß Code Contributions
Whether you're fixing bugs or building new features, every contribution helps!

**What we especially need help with:**
- Increasing test coverage (currently 38.57%)
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations  
- Aviation-specific UI components
- Mobile responsiveness enhancements
- Security enhancements

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** (we recommend using the latest LTS)
- **npm 9+** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** for version control

### Local Development

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CFIPros-frontend.git
   cd CFIPros-frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # Edit .env.local with your settings
   # You'll need to set up your own backend API or use mock data
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Backend Integration

This frontend requires a backend API. You have several options:

1. **Mock Development**: Use the existing API route patterns with mock data
2. **Own Backend**: Build your own following the API patterns in `app/api/`
3. **CFIPros API**: Contact us at [hello@cfipros.com](mailto:hello@cfipros.com) for API access

## üß™ Testing

We take testing seriously. All contributions should include appropriate tests.

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage       # Generate coverage report
npm run test:security       # Run security-specific tests
```

### Writing Tests
- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: For component interactions and API routes
- **Security Tests**: For file upload validation and security features

Example test structure:
```typescript
// __tests__/components/ui/Button.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';

describe('Button Component', () => {
  it('renders with correct text', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## üìù Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing or `unknown`

### React/Next.js
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer Server Components when possible (Next.js App Router)
- Use proper error boundaries
- Implement loading and error states

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow existing design patterns
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Test accessibility (use screen readers, keyboard navigation)

### Code Formatting
We use automated formatting tools:
```bash
npm run lint                # ESLint checks
npm run lint:fix           # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run type-check         # TypeScript validation
```

## üìã Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Test Everything**
   ```bash
   npm test                 # All tests pass
   npm run build           # Build succeeds
   npm run type-check      # No TypeScript errors
   npm run lint            # No linting errors
   ```

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README if you changed core functionality
   - Add JSDoc comments for new functions
   - Update type definitions if needed

3. **Follow Commit Convention**
   We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```
   feat: add new aviation-specific component
   fix: resolve mobile navigation issue
   docs: update contributing guidelines
   test: add tests for file upload security
